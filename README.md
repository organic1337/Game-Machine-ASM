Game Machine is basically a DosBox game, written purely in Assembly 8086. In order to try out the game you should run the GM.exe file
through the DosBox (I recommend you to set the cycles to 4500 for best experience). The Game Machine contains 3 mini games:

- **Pong**: Including 2 modes, singleplayer and multiplayer, enables you to train in front of a wall or compete
with your friends on 1 vs 1 match.
- **Breakout:** Including 20 levels, each level you gain a life point. As you progress in the level, the game becomes faster so you must keep up!
- **Snake:** Including 3 different modes: easy, medium, hard. You should start with the easy difficulty and than start moving to medium and eventually hard.

All three games contain instructions.

## About the project
This project was used as the first year final project in assembly 8086. In cyber class we had to make a massive project
in assembly 8086.

## Assembly 8086
The project was written in assembly 8086 using Notepad++, Turbo Debugger and DosBox.
